# Reservation System

This course's final report aims to establish a microservice reservation system on Kubernetes. Use Django as the framework to develop a reservation system, use Django REST framework to achieve communication between different microservices, use Docker to create a container image, and finally, use Kubernetes to deploy microservices. This system uses Kubernetes to achieve automatic deployment, expansion, and execution of applications and uses Kubernetes' Scheduler to schedule resource allocation to help manage the three microservices in the system.
